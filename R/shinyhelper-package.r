#' shinyhelper.
#'
#' Easily add markdown helpfiles to your shiny apps, by adding a single function
#' around a shiny app element. This adds a small icon (a question mark, by default)
#' which presents content in a modal dialog box when clicked. The content can be passed 
#' inline or given in a markdown file.
#' 
#' There is also a convenient function to initialise a directory of markdown files
#' given a vector of filenames.
#' 
#' A demo is available at \url{https://cwthom94.shinyapps.io/shinyhelper-demo/}
