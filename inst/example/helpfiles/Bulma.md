## MARKDOWN HELPER WITH BULMA

---
This should show a modal with help in Bulma style. 

---

You can also include mathematical formulae using the `withMathJax` argument to `observe_helpers()`
This allows for elements in your help such as:
$$ y_{bulma} = \sum_{i=0}^{i=Inf} all things bulma_i \times i $$
